# Invisible Individuals
In an attempt to identify limitations and improve facial recognition of marginalized identities, our research consisted of two parts:
1. Creating a diverse and unconstrained (in relation to pose, illumination and expression) dataset comprised of both synthesized and photographed images

2. Identifying limitations of existing tools in classifying gender by auditing a lightweight, open source gender classification algorithm. We worked on answering the following questions:
- Are these facial recognition algorithms really as accurate as the researchers who developed them say they are?
- Can these algorithms consistently maintain its performance and accurately classify the genders of individuals across racial groups?
